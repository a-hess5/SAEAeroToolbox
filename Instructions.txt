I want to scrape airfoils from the airfoil tools website to use for my project!
    - Please don't. They don't like it
    - But if you have to, use the AirfoilScrapeMultipleReynoldsAoA
        - This runs and scrapes from Airfoiltools.com
    - My data is already in foil_data_new_pg... across two files. Use these

I want to find the thrust curve equation for my propeller
    - Download the .dat file you want to use and put it in the prop test sim folder
    - Use the propThrustSim and enter the file of your .dat file
    - It will generate an equation for you
    - Copy the equation to dynamic takeoff and climb (if necessary)

I want to simulate different airfoils to see how well they work for my design
    - Copy the thrust curve and paste it in
    - Change the variables for your airplane so far
    - Change the title for what you want
    - Run it to output a sheet
